Developing new audio-visual speech models. My main project has been [Automated Dubbing for Instagrams Reels](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/r-mira_metaconnect-activity-7247958649015300097-V0pD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACSp3PQBdN14IwYCrssMeDvL1eKhsWJkjKA). I have also written papers on audio-visual speech enhancement ([Interspeech 2024](/publications/rt-la-voce)), speech extraction ([ICASSP 2025](/publications/cse)), speech recognition ([NeurIPS 2024](/publications/usr)), and facial animation ([CVPR 2025](/_publications/keyface) + [under review](/_publications/keysync)  + [under review](/_publications/lookahead-anchoring)).
