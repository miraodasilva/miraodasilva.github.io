Developing new audio-visual speech models. My main project has been [Automated Dubbing for Instagrams Reels](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/r-mira_metaconnect-activity-7247958649015300097-V0pD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACSp3PQBdN14IwYCrssMeDvL1eKhsWJkjKA). I have also written papers on [Real-time Audio-visual Speech Enhancement (Interspeech 2024)](/publications/rt-la-voce) [Contextual Speech Extraction (ICASSP 2025)](/publications/cse), [Unified Speech Recognition (NeurIPS 2024)](/publications/usr), [Expressive Facial Animation (CVPR 2025)](/_publications/keyface), and others which are currently under review.
