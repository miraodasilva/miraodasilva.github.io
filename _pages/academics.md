## Workshop Organization
I am one of the main organizers of the [Audio-Visual Generation and Learning workshop](https://avgen123.github.io/), presented at ECCV 2024 and ICCV 2025.


## Teaching
As mentioned in the [Experience section](/experience/teaching-intro-to-ml), I worked as a teaching assistant (TA) for the [Introduction to Machine Learning (70050)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/current-students/courses/70050/) course in early 2020, led by [Dr. Josiah Wang](http://josiahwang.com/) at Imperial College London. 

## Supervision
Together with Prof. Bj√∂rn Schuller, I supervised Ryan Perkins for his MSc thesis entitled "Bootstrapping Stable Diffusion for Audio Synthesis". The project was awarded "Distinguished" status, and the final grade was 88/100.
