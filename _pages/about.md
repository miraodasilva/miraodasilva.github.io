👋 Hi, my name is Rodrigo and I'm a Senior Research Scientist at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) in New York City. Before that, I was as a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Meta](https://ai.meta.com/) working on new approaches for generative modeling and self-supervised learning on audio-visual speech. At Meta, my main project was [Automated Dubbing for Instagrams Reels](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/r-mira_metaconnect-activity-7247958649015300097-V0pD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACSp3PQBdN14IwYCrssMeDvL1eKhsWJkjKA), where I worked on speech-driven facial animation/lip synchronization. I also spend a lot of my time on papers, about which you can find out more on the [Publications section](/publications/).

📚 I completed my BSc in Information Systems and Computer Engineering at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/pt/), as well as my MSc and PhD in Computing at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). Details are available on the [Education section](/education/).

🖥️ I spent a substantial portion of my PhD interning and working at [Meta](https://ai.meta.com/), where I collaborated with multiple teams and developed my PhD research. I also joined Sony R&D as a research intern in Tokyo briefly after completing my PhD, where I worked on video-to-audio generation. Details are available on the [Experience section](/experience/).

🔬🤖 My research is focused on understanding and generating audio-visual speech (i.e., audio and video of people talking), particularly through self-supervised learning and generative methods such as diffusion models. Details are available on the [Publications section](/publications/).

🎓 During my time as a researcher, I've reviewed for many of the leading conferences and journals in the field, including CVPR, NeurIPS (Top Reviewer 2023), ICLR, ICML, TPAMI, and IJCV. I have also served as a session chair in ICASSP 2025, and am one of the main organizers of the [AVGenL workshop](https://avgen123.github.io/iccv25.html) (ECCV 2024 and ICCV 2025). Details are available on the [Academics section](/academics/).

🗣️ I have given live talks about my research in multiple conferences including [CVPR](/talks/wss-2022), [Interspeech](/talks/oral-interspeech-2022), and [ICASSP](/talks/icassp-2020). I also engage with the machine learning online community directly through platforms such as [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/r-mira/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RodrigomiraA), and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/MiraoDaSilva). Details are available on the [Talks](/talks/) and [Online Presence](/online_presence/) sections.

🎸🎾 During my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar and bass, and also playing racket sports such as squash, tennis, and pickleball. Details are available on the [Extra-curricular section](/extra_curricular/).

📃 My CV is available on the [CV section](/cv/).
