👋 Hi, my name is Rodrigo and I'm a Senior Research Scientist at Google DeepMind in New York City. Before that, I was as a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Meta](https://ai.meta.com/) working on new approaches for generative modeling and self-supervised learning on audio-visual speech. Currently, my main project is [Automated Dubbing for Instagrams Reels](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/r-mira_metaconnect-activity-7247958649015300097-V0pD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACSp3PQBdN14IwYCrssMeDvL1eKhsWJkjKA), where I work on speech-driven facial animation/lip synchronization. I also spend a lot of my time on papers, about which you can find out more on the [Publications section](/publications/).

📚 I completed my BSc in Information Systems and Computer Engineering at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/pt/), as well as my MSc and PhD in Computing at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). Details are available on the [Education section](/education/).

🖥️ I spent a substantial portion of my PhD interning and working at [Meta](https://ai.meta.com/), where I collaborated with multiple teams and developed my PhD research. I also joined Sony R&D in Tokyo briefly after completing my PhD, as a research intern, where I worked on video-to-audio generation. Details are available on the [Experience section](/experience/).

🔬🤖 My research is focused on deep learning applied to audio-visual speech (i.e., faces, lip movements and speech). In particular, I am interested in applying self-supervised learning to learn from unlabelled audio-visual speech. I am also interested and have experience in generative modelling, particularly in generating speech using generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models. Details are available on the [Publications section](/publications/).

🎓 During my time as a researcher, I have contributed to the academic community in multiple ways. Firstly, I've reviewed for many of the leading conferences and journals in the field, including CVPR, NeurIPS (Top Reviewer 2023), TPAMI, and IJCV. Furthermore, I have a served as a session chair in ICASSP 2025, and was one of the main organizers of the [AVGenL workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/avgenl) at ICCV 2024. I have also worked as a teaching assistant for Introduction to Machine Learning at Imperial College London. Details are available on the [Academics section](/academics/).

🗣️ I have given live talks about my research in multiple conferences including [CVPR](/talks/wss-2022), [Interspeech](/talks/oral-interspeech-2022), and [ICASSP](/talks/icassp-2020). I also engage with the machine learning online community directly through platforms such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RodrigomiraA) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/MiraoDaSilva). Details are available on the [Talks](/talks/) and [Online Presence](/online_presence/) sections.

🎸🎾 During my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar and bass (usually with a band). I also play squash with my colleagues from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) on a weekly basis. Details are available on the [Extra-curricular section](/extra_curricular/).

📃 My CV is available on the [CV section](/cv/).
